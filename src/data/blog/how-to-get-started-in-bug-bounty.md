## 🧠 Intro

Let me be honest: I didn’t know much about cybersecurity when I first discovered bug bounty. But I was curious, and that was enough.

If you’re reading this, you’re already one step ahead. You’re searching, learning, and that’s the beginning of every hacker’s journey.

## 🐞 What is Bug Bounty?

Bug bounty is a program run by companies where they pay hackers (like you and me) to **find and report vulnerabilities** in their websites, apps, or systems.

| Term         | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vulnerability | A bug or flaw in software that can be misused                          |
| Bounty       | The reward (money or swag) given for reporting a valid bug              |
| Responsible Disclosure | Reporting the bug to the company instead of exploiting it |

## 🧰 Skills You Need (But Don’t Panic)

You don’t need to be a genius or a pro coder to start. These are the key areas to focus on:

| Skill Area           | Description                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Basic Web Knowledge  | HTML, JS, HTTP methods, cookies              |
| Linux Basics         | Navigating the terminal, using tools         |
| Burp Suite           | Your main toolkit for web hacking            |
| Reconnaissance       | Finding hidden pages, parameters, subdomains |
| Report Writing       | Explain your bugs clearly and professionally |

Start one step at a time. You don’t need to learn everything at once.

## 🔧 Toolbox for Starters

Here are some tools I personally used when I began:

| Tool         | Purpose                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Burp Suite   | Intercept and modify web traffic|
| Nmap         | Scan for open ports/services    |
| Sublist3r    | Subdomain Enumeration           |
| Dirsearch    | Directory brute-forcing         |
| HackerOne CLI| For writing and managing reports|

> 💡 Tip: Don’t overload yourself with tools. Pick 2–3 and get comfortable with them.

## 💡 Tips from My Early Days

These are things I wish someone told me earlier:

- Start small. Don’t go after critical bugs on Day 1.
- Learn **how web apps work** before trying to break them.
- Read **public reports** on HackerOne to see real bugs.
- Take notes in Notion, Obsidian, or a markdown file.
- Celebrate small wins (even if it's just learning how cookies work).

## 🚫 Common Beginner Mistakes

| Mistake                    | Why It's a Problem                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Blindly scanning websites  | May get you banned or ignored               |
| Using too many tools       | Confuses more than it helps                 |
| Not reading program rules  | Every target has different scope and rules  |
| Giving up too soon         | Most people fail early. Keep going!         |

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I start without coding skills?**  
Yes! Learn the basics as you go. Bug bounty is about creativity and problem-solving more than deep coding.

**Q: How much can I earn?**  
Some people make thousands, some nothing. Focus on **learning first**, money comes later.

**Q: Is it legal?**  
If you stay within the **program’s scope** and follow responsible disclosure, yes, it’s 100% legal.

## ❤️ Outro

I still remember the day I found my first XSS. I jumped around my room like a kid who just beat the final boss in a game.

If you’re struggling, trust me—you’re not alone. We all start confused. We all feel like imposters. But with patience, passion, and practice, you'll get there.

Start now. Don’t wait until you “know everything.” Just begin.
