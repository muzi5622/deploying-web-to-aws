## 🔧 Installation

Before we begin, install Docker on your system:

👉 [Click here to visit the official Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)

---

## 🐳 What is Docker? Why Use It?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to **package, distribute, and run applications in isolated environments** called **containers**.

It provides a standardized way to ensure software runs consistently across different environments. Everything runs in a lightweight, portable package — making development, testing, and deployment faster and more reliable.

---

## 🧱 Containers vs Virtual Machines

| Feature         | Containers                           | Virtual Machines                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Isolation      | Process-level                         | Full OS-level                        |
| Speed          | Lightweight and fast                  | Heavy and slow startup               |
| Size           | Small (MBs)                           | Large (GBs)                          |
| Use Cases      | Microservices, CI/CD, App packaging   | Full OS testing, legacy apps         |

## 🧠 Docker Architecture

Docker is made up of the following components:

- **Docker Engine**: Core runtime environment.
- **Docker CLI**: Command-line interface to communicate with the engine.
- **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`): Background service handling containers and images.
- **Docker Hub**: A registry for sharing and downloading Docker images.
- **Images & Containers**: Blueprints vs instances.

---

## 🛠️ Key Docker Components

### 🔹 Images

- Immutable blueprint of an application.
- Versioned and portable.
- Pulled from registries like Docker Hub.

### 🔹 Containers

- Running instances of images.
- Isolated environments for applications.
- Can be started, stopped, restarted, or deleted.

### 🔹 Volumes

- Used for data persistence.
- Exist outside the container’s filesystem.

### 🔹 Networks

- Allow inter-container communication.
- Default types: `bridge`, `host`, and `none`.

---

## 🧾 What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a text-based script of instructions for building a Docker image.

Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
````

---

## ⚙️ Useful Docker Commands & Flags

### 🔍 Check Version & System Info

```bash
docker --version
docker info
```

---

### 📥 Pulling an Image

```bash
docker pull alpine
```

Downloads the Alpine base image.

---

### 🚀 Running a Container

**Interactive shell inside Alpine:**

```bash
docker run -it alpine sh
```

**Running an nginx container on port 8080:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name web nginx
```

Common flags:

* `-d`: Detached mode
* `-p`: Port mapping (host\:container)
* `--name`: Custom container name
* `--rm`: Auto-remove on exit
* `-v`: Mount a volume

---

### 📋 Managing Containers

**List containers:**

```bash
docker ps        # Running only
docker ps -a     # All, including stopped
```

**Stop, start, remove containers:**

```bash
docker stop mycontainer
docker start mycontainer
docker rm mycontainer
```

---

### 📦 Working with Images

**List all images:**

```bash
docker images
```

**Remove an image:**

```bash
docker rmi nginx
```

---

## 🧭 What’s Next?

In the next part, we’ll explore how to **build your own Docker images using Dockerfiles**, manage image layers efficiently, and follow best practices for optimized builds.

Stay tuned for **Part 2: Building Docker Images Like a Pro**.
