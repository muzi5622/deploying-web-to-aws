## 🧠 Intro

In 2025, cybersecurity is booming. More apps, more data, more vulnerabilities—and more demand for skilled hackers.

But it’s easy to get lost in the noise. This roadmap is **realistic**, **beginner-friendly**, and **updated for today’s tools and threats**.

## 🛡️ What Is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking means legally breaking into systems to **find vulnerabilities before the bad guys do**.

You think like an attacker—but act like a guardian.

It includes:

- Web App Testing
- Network Pentesting
- Malware Analysis
- Bug Bounty Hunting
- Red Team / Blue Team Ops

## 🛠️ Build Projects and a Portfolio

Start small but make it real:

- WiFi scanner in Python
- Port scanner or web recon tool
- Write hacking writeups
- Build a GitHub profile
- Create a simple blog (AstroPaper!)

This shows you’re serious—not just learning, but doing.
