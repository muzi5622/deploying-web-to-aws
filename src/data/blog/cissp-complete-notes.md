## CIA

The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of information security, ensuring that data is:

1. **Confidentiality** – Protecting information from unauthorized access.
2. **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered.
3. **Availability** – Ensuring information and systems are accessible when needed.

### **Additional Security Properties**

1. **Authenticity (Authentication)** – Verifying the identity of users, systems, or data sources to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Accountability** – Ensuring that actions can be traced to an individual or system through auditing and logging.
3. **Non-repudiation** – Preventing entities from denying their actions by using cryptographic mechanisms like digital signatures and log records.

These additional properties strengthen the **CIA Triad** and are essential for comprehensive security in **CISSP** and other cybersecurity frameworks.

---

## Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering

🧱 1. **Security Architecture Basics**

- It’s how we **design**, **build**, and **manage** secure systems.
- Think of it like the blueprint for a secure building.

---

### 🛡️ 2. **Security Models (How Security Works in a System)**

- **Bell-LaPadula (BLP)** – Protects **confidentiality**.
    - No Read Up, No Write Down.
    - Example: A secret-level user can’t read top-secret files.
- **Biba Model** – Protects **integrity**.
    - No Write Up, No Read Down.
    - Example: A low-level user can’t change high-level data.
- **Clark-Wilson** – Focuses on data integrity using **rules** and **roles**.
- **Brewer-Nash (Coca-Cola Model)** – Prevents **conflicts of interest**.
    - Users can't access competing company data.
- **Bell-LaPadula = Confidentiality**
    
    **Biba = Integrity**
    

---

### 🏗️ 3. **Security Architecture Concepts**

- **Defense in Depth** – Use multiple layers of security (firewall + antivirus + monitoring).
- **Security Domains** – Separated areas with their own rules (e.g., admin network vs. guest network).
- **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** – Part of a system you must **trust** to be secure.
- **Security Perimeter** – Boundary where the TCB ends.

---

### 🧠 4. **System Security Concepts**

- **Process Isolation** – One program can’t affect another.
- **Memory Protection** – Stop programs from reading other program’s memory.
- **Virtual Memory** – Treat physical memory and disk as one.
- **Reference Monitor** – Always checks if a user is allowed to access something.
- **Security Kernel** – The part of the OS that enforces the rules.

---

### 🧰 5. **Security Capabilities of Systems**

- **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** – Separate device for handling cryptographic keys.
- **Full Disk Encryption** – Encrypts all data on a disk (e.g., BitLocker).
- **Secure Boot** – Makes sure the system starts only with trusted software.

---

### 🧪 6. **System Evaluation Methods**

- **Common Criteria (ISO 15408)** – Global standard for evaluating security.
    - **EAL1–EAL7** – Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL7 = highest assurance).
- **TCSEC (Orange Book)** – U.S. standard, focuses on confidentiality.
- **ITSEC** – European standard (focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability).

---

### ⚙️ 7. **Cryptography Basics (More in Domain 4)**

- Supports **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, **Authentication**, and **Non-repudiation**.
- Common Tools: Hashing, Symmetric/Asymmetric Encryption, Digital Signatures.

---

### 🌍 8. **Physical Security Controls**

    - **Deterrent** – Makes attackers think twice (e.g., signs, lights).
    - **Preventive** – Stops access (e.g., locks, fences).
    - **Detective** – Finds intrusions (e.g., cameras, alarms).
    - **Corrective** – Fixes problems after they happen (e.g., fire extinguishers).
    - **Compensating** – Backup controls (e.g., guard if lock fails)

---

## **Biba Model**

The **Biba Model** is a security model that protects **data integrity** (making sure data is not changed in an unsafe way). It follows two simple rules:

1. **No-Read-Down** → You **can’t read** data from a lower (less trustworthy) level.
    - Example: A high-level bank manager **can’t** read data from an unverified source to avoid bad information.
2. **No-Write-Up** → You **can’t write** data to a higher (more trustworthy) level.
    - Example: A normal employee **can’t** change critical financial records to prevent mistakes or fraud.

This model is used in **banks, government systems, and security software** to keep important data safe from corruption.

## **Brewer-Nash Model**

The **Brewer-Nash Model**, also called the **Chinese Wall Model**, is a security model designed to prevent **conflicts of interest** in industries like **finance, law, and consulting**.

### **How It Works**

The model **blocks access** to data that could create a conflict of interest. It does this by grouping data into **conflict of interest classes** (COI).

### **Two Main Rules:**

1. **No-Read-Conflict:**
    - If a user (e.g., an analyst) **accesses data from one company**, they **can’t read** data from a competing company in the same group.
    - Example: If a financial analyst sees data from **Company A**, they **can’t read** data from **Company B**, which is a competitor.
2. **No-Write-Conflict:**
    - A user **can’t write** data that could cause a conflict of interest.
    - Example: If an analyst worked with **Company A**, they **can’t provide reports** for **Company B**, ensuring fairness.

### **Why is it Important?**

- Prevents **insider trading** and **biased decision-making**.
- Used in **banks, investment firms, and legal offices** to ensure ethical practices.

## **Clark-Wilson Security Model**

The **Clark-Wilson Security Model** is a security framework focused on **data integrity** in business and financial systems. It ensures that only authorized users can modify data in a controlled way.

### **Key Principles:**

1. **Well-formed Transactions**
    - Users **can’t directly change** important data. Instead, they must go through **approved procedures** (like a banking system that requires multiple steps for a transaction).
2. **Separation of Duties**
    - No single person has complete control over a critical process.
    - Example: One employee **enters** financial data, while another **approves** it.
3. **Access Control Based on Roles**
    - Users get access only to what they need for their job.
    - Example: A cashier can update sales records, but only a manager can approve refunds.

### **Why is it Important?**

- Prevents **fraud, errors, and unauthorized changes**.
- Used in **banks, financial institutions, and enterprise systems** where data accuracy is critical.

## Graham-Denning Security Model

This model focuses on **secure access control** by defining **how subjects (users/processes) interact with objects (files, resources)** in a system.

### **Key Idea:**

The model describes **eight rules (operations)** that control how subjects **create, delete, and manage** objects and other subjects.

### **The 8 Rules of Graham-Denning Model:**

1. **Create Object** – A user can create a new file or resource.
2. **Delete Object** – A user can remove a file or resource.
3. **Create Subject** – A new user/process can be created.
4. **Delete Subject** – A user/process can be removed.
5. **Read Access** – A subject can read an object’s data.
6. **Write Access** – A subject can modify an object’s data.
7. **Grant Access Rights** – A subject can give another subject permissions.
8. **Delete Access Rights** – A subject can take away another subject’s permissions.

### **Why is it Important?**

- Provides a **structured way** to manage permissions in a system.
- Helps in **preventing unauthorized access and maintaining security**.
- Used in **operating systems, databases, and secure computing environments**.

## Encryption

### Definitions:

1. **Cryptography:** The practice and study of techniques for secure communication to prevent unauthorized access. It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.
2. **Encryption:** The process of converting readable information (plaintext) into a coded form (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Decryption:** The reverse of encryption, converting ciphertext back to plaintext.
4. **Cipher:** A pair of algorithms for encryption and decryption, controlled by a key.
5. **Key:** A secret string of characters used to encrypt and decrypt information.
6. **Symmetric Cryptography:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption; faster but less secure for large systems.
7. **Asymmetric Cryptography:** Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption; more secure but slower.
8. **Hashing:** A method to convert data into a fixed-length string (hash value) that is difficult to reverse, often used for data integrity.
9. **Cryptanalysis:** The study of techniques to break encryption and decode messages without access to the key.

### Summary of Key Topics:

1. **Cryptography Basics:** Originally focused on converting plaintext to ciphertext for secrecy. Modern cryptography addresses confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.
2. **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography:** Symmetric uses a single shared key, while asymmetric uses paired public and private keys. Asymmetric is more secure for large-scale communication.
3. **Hashing:** Used for data integrity and authentication. Unlike encryption, hashing is one-way and irreversible.
4. **Cryptanalysis:** Attempts to break encryption methods. Includes techniques like frequency analysis and side-channel attacks.
5. **Data Protection:** Data can be protected while at rest (stored) or in transit (being transmitted). Both can use encryption to ensure security.

### Main Points:

- Cryptography aims to secure data and communication.
- Encryption and decryption are core processes.
- Symmetric encryption is faster but requires key management.
- Asymmetric encryption is more secure for large systems.

### **Encoding and Decoding**

- **Encoding:** Changing information into a different format for easy transmission or storage. It's not for security, just for compatibility.
    - **Example:** Turning text into Morse code so it can be sent through radio signals.
- **Decoding:** Changing the encoded message back to its original form.
    - **Example:** Translating Morse code back into text.

---

### **Transposition in Cryptography**

- **What it is:** Rearranging the order of characters in the plaintext to create the ciphertext. Unlike substitution, it doesn't change the actual characters—just their positions.
- **Example:** If the message is **"HELLO"**, a transposition might rearrange it to **"LOLEH"**.
- **Purpose:** To make the message harder to understand without the correct key.

In simple terms, transposition is like shuffling a deck of cards—the cards (characters) stay the same, but their order changes.

### **Confusion**

- **What it means:** Making the link between the key and the coded message hard to understand.
- **Why it matters:** If someone tries to guess the key, they should struggle because the coded message looks too mixed up.
- **Example:** Imagine mixing paint colors. Once you add many colors, it's hard to tell which one caused a specific shade.

---

### **Diffusion**

- **What it means:** Spreading the impact of each part of the message across the whole coded message.
- **Why it matters:** It hides patterns, making it harder to guess the original message.
- **Example:** If you spill ink on a page, it spreads out. The more it spreads, the harder it is to see the original letters.

---

**In Short:**

- Confusion = Making it hard to guess the key.
- Diffusion = Hiding patterns in the message.

### **Key Clustering**

- **What it is:** A situation in cryptography where two different keys generate the same ciphertext from the same plaintext.
- **Why it's a problem:** It weakens encryption because finding one of the keys can help guess the other, reducing security.
- **Example:** Imagine two different keys **1234** and **5678** that, when used to encrypt the word **"SECRET"**, both give the same result **"X1B3Z7"**. This overlap is key clustering.

**In short:** Key clustering is like having two different locks that can be opened by the same key — it's not supposed to happen and can make things less secure.

### **Synchronous and Asynchronous in Cryptography**

---

### **1. Synchronous (Symmetric) Encryption:**

- **What it is:** Uses the **same key** to encrypt and decrypt data.
- **How it works:** The sender and receiver must both have the same key, which must be kept secret.
- **Example:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Analogy:** Like having the same key for locking and unlocking a door. Both people need the same key.
- **Pros:** Fast and efficient for large amounts of data.
- **Cons:** The key must be shared securely, which can be challenging.

---

### **2. Asynchronous (Asymmetric) Encryption:**

- **What it is:** Uses **two keys** — a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.
- **How it works:** The public key is shared openly, but the private key is kept secret by the receiver.
- **Example:** RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- **Analogy:** Like a mailbox — anyone can put a letter (encrypt) inside using the public key, but only the owner with the private key can take it out (decrypt).
- **Pros:** No need to share the private key, making it more secure for key exchange.
- **Cons:** Slower and more resource-intensive than symmetric encryption.

---

**In Short:**

- **Synchronous (Symmetric) = Same Key** — Fast, but secure key sharing needed.
- **Asynchronous (Asymmetric) = Public & Private Keys** — More secure, but slower.

---

---

---

- **Example:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Secure and suitable for:** Large data files and storage.

---

### **5. Initialization Vector (IV)**

- **What it is:** A random value added to the plaintext before encryption.
- **Why needed:** Ensures the same plaintext doesn't produce the same ciphertext, increasing security.
- **Example:** Like adding a random "salt" to a password to make it unique.

---

### **6. One-Time Pad**

- **What it is:** An encryption method using a random, secret key as long as the message itself.
- **Why secure:** If used correctly (never reused), it's unbreakable.
- **Challenge:** The key must be as long as the message and kept completely secret.

- **Purpose:** To keep the existence of the message a secret.
- **Example:** Hiding text in the color data of an image file.

---

### **8. ECB vs. CBC (Modes of Block Cipher)**

- **ECB (Electronic Codebook):**
    - **How it works:** Encrypts each block of plaintext separately.
    - **Problem:** Identical plaintext blocks create identical ciphertext, revealing patterns.
    - **Example:** Like stamping the same seal on each page — easy to spot duplicates.
- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining):**
    - **How it works:** Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
    - **Benefit:** Hides patterns; more secure than ECB.
    - **Example:** Like linking a chain — each link (block) depends on the previous one.

---

### **Stream vs. Block Ciphers:**

- **Stream Cipher:** Encrypts data **bit by bit** or **byte by byte**. Faster and ideal for real-time data like voice or video.
    - **Example:** RC4 (now considered insecure)
- **Block Cipher:** Encrypts data in **fixed-size blocks** (e.g., 64 or 128 bits). More secure and commonly used for file encryption.
    - **Example:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

---

## **Block Cipher Modes of Operation:**

### **1. CFB (Cipher Feedback Mode):**

- **How it works:** Uses an **Initialization Vector (IV)**. Encrypts small segments (like stream ciphers) using a block cipher.
- **Purpose:** Good for streaming data, like network communications.
- **Example:** Like a relay race — each runner (block) relies on the previous one.

---

### **2. OFB (Output Feedback Mode):**

- **How it works:** The block cipher output is fed back into the encryption process, creating a stream of random bits. The IV and key generate this stream.
- **Purpose:** Good for noisy channels, as errors don't spread.
- **Example:** Like a playlist on repeat — the same track (key stream) plays repeatedly.

---

### **3. CTR (Counter Mode):**

- **How it works:** Uses a counter that increments with each block. The counter is combined with the key to create a unique keystream.
- **Purpose:** Fast and can encrypt multiple blocks simultaneously. Widely used for parallel processing.
- **Example:** Like numbered pages — each page (block) has a unique number (counter).

---

**In Short:**

- **CFB:** Feeds previous ciphertext into the encryption.
- **OFB:** Feeds the block cipher's output to create a key stream.
- **CTR:** Uses a counter to generate a unique key stream for each block.

These modes help block ciphers work like stream ciphers, offering flexibility and better security in different situations.

### 🔧 8. **Resource Protection**

- **Data classification** – Label data (Public, Internal, Confidential, Secret).
- **Media protection** – Secure storage and disposal of USBs, hard drives, etc.
- **Data destruction** – Shred, wipe, or degauss before discarding.

---

### 🧪 9. **Testing Controls**

- **Tabletop Exercise** – Team talks through a simulated incident.
- **Drills** – Practice emergency procedures.
- **Full interruption test** – Actually shut systems down (rare and risky).
- **Simulation test** – Act like a real disaster, without turning things off.

---

### 🛰️ 10. **SIEM and Monitoring**

- **SIEM (Security Info and Event Management)** – Collects and analyzes logs.
- Helps **detect attacks early** and alert the team.
- Example tools: Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight.

---

### 🧯 11. **Fire Prevention & Safety**

- Fire suppression systems:
    - **Water** – For regular fires (not good for servers).
    - **Gas-based (like FM-200)** – For data centers.
- Always follow safety procedures to protect people and equipment.

## **CISSP Domain 8: Software Development Security**

---

### 💻 1. **What Is Software Development Security?**

- It’s about **making software secure** from the beginning.
- Goal: Build apps that are **safe, trusted, and hard to hack**.

---

### 🧱 2. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

> SDLC = Steps followed to make software.
> 

**Phases:**

1. **Planning** – What are we building?
2. **Design** – How will it work?
3. **Development** – Write the code.
4. **Testing** – Check for bugs or security issues.
5. **Deployment** – Release it to users.
6. **Maintenance** – Fix bugs, update as needed.

🛡️ Add **security at every step** (called *Secure SDLC*).

---

### 🧪 3. **Software Testing Types**

- **Static Testing** – Check code without running it (e.g., code review).
- **Dynamic Testing** – Run the program and test it live.
- **Fuzz Testing** – Send random data to see if it crashes.
- **Regression Testing** – Make sure old features still work after changes.

---

### 🔐 4. **Common Software Flaws**

- **Buffer Overflow** – Too much data crashes memory.
- **SQL Injection** – Attacker tricks database with code.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** – Injects code into a webpage.
- **Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)** – Tricks users into doing things they didn’t mean to.
- **Insecure APIs** – Weak links between apps.

🛠️ **Fix bugs early** to avoid bigger problems later.

---

### 🛑 5. **Secure Coding Practices**

- **Input Validation** – Always check user input.
- **Output Encoding** – Clean data before showing it.
- **Error Handling** – Don’t show system details in error messages.
- **Principle of Least Privilege** – Code runs with minimum access.
- **Code Signing** – Verify code comes from a trusted source.

---

### 👥 6. **Development Roles**

- **Developers** – Write and test code.
- **Testers** – Find bugs or security holes.
- **Architects** – Design overall structure.
- **Security Team** – Help secure the software.

Everyone must **work together** for secure software.

---

### 🔁 7. **Change & Version Control**

- **Change Management** – Plan and approve software updates.
- **Version Control** – Track changes in code (e.g., Git).
- Helps teams work better and avoid mistakes.

---

### 📜 8. **Software Security Models & Concepts**

- **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** – Core part of the system that must stay secure.
- **Security Models** (like Bell-LaPadula, Biba) – Rules for access and control.
- **Reference Monitor** – Always-enforced, always-invoked access control logic.

---

### 🔧 9. **Software Development Methods**

- **Waterfall** – Step-by-step, one phase at a time.
- **Agile** – Fast, flexible, small updates.
- **DevOps** – Dev + Operations working together.
- **DevSecOps** – Dev + Security + Ops (security built into DevOps process).

---

### 📥 10. **Third-Party & Open-Source Software**

- Must be checked for:
    - Malware
    - Licensing issues
    - Hidden vulnerabilities
- Use tools to **scan and monitor** open-source components.

---

### ⚙️ 11. **Deployment & Secure Environments**

- **Production** – Live system users interact with.
- **Staging/Test** – Used to test before going live.
- **Development** – Where coding happens.

💡 Never mix testing and production environments!
